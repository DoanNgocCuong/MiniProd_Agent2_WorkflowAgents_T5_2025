For each new fact, decide whether to:\\n- ADD: Add it to the memory as a new element\\n- UPDATE: Update an existing memory element\\n- DELETE: Delete an existing memory element\\n- NONE: Make no change (if the fact is already present or irrelevant)\\n\\nThere are specific guidelines to select which operation to perform:\\n\\n1. **Add**: If the retrieved facts contain new information not present in the memory, then you have to add it by generating a new ID in the id field.\\n- **Example**:\\n    - Old Memory:\\n        [\\n            {{\\n                \\\"id\\\" : \\\"0\\\",\\n                \\\"text\\\" : \\\"User is a software engineer\\\"\\n            }}\\n        ]\\n    - Retrieved facts: [\\\"Name is John\\\"]\\n    - New Memory:\\n        {{\\n            \\\"memory\\\" : [\\n                {{\\n                    \\\"id\\\" : \\\"0\\\",\\n                    \\\"text\\\" : \\\"User is a software engineer\\\",\\n                    \\\"event\\\" : \\\"NONE\\\"\\n                }},\\n                {{\\n                    \\\"id\\\" : \\\"1\\\",\\n                    \\\"text\\\" : \\\"Name is John\\\",\\n                    \\\"event\\\" : \\\"ADD\\\"\\n                }}\\n            ]\\n\\n        }}\\n\\n2. **Update**: If the retrieved facts contain information that is already present in the memory but the information is totally different, then you have to update it. \\nIf the retrieved fact contains information that conveys the same thing as the elements present in the memory, then you have to keep the fact which has the most information. \\nExample (a) -- if the memory contains \\\"User likes to play cricket\\\" and the retrieved fact is \\\"Loves to play cricket with friends\\\", then update the memory with the retrieved facts.\\nExample (b) -- if the memory contains \\\"Likes cheese pizza\\\" and the retrieved fact is \\\"Loves cheese pizza\\\", then you do not need to update it because they convey the same information.\\nIf the direction is to update the memory, then you have to update it.\\nPlease keep in mind while updating you have to keep the same ID.\\nPlease note to return the IDs in the output from the input IDs only and do not generate any new ID.\\n- **Example**:\\n    - Old Memory:\\n        [\\n            {{\\n                \\\"id\\\" : \\\"0\\\",\\n                \\\"text\\\" : \\\"I really like cheese pizza\\\"\\n            }},\\n            {{\\n                \\\"id\\\" : \\\"1\\\",\\n                \\\"text\\\" : \\\"User is a software engineer\\\"\\n            }},\\n            {{\\n                \\\"id\\\" : \\\"2\\\",\\n                \\\"text\\\" : \\\"User likes to play cricket\\\"\\n            }}\\n        ]\\n    - Retrieved facts: [\\\"Loves chicken pizza\\\", \\\"Loves to play cricket with friends\\\"]\\n    - New Memory:\\n        {{\\n        \\\"memory\\\" : [\\n                {{\\n                    \\\"id\\\" : \\\"0\\\",\\n                    \\\"text\\\" : \\\"Loves cheese and chicken pizza\\\",\\n                    \\\"event\\\" : \\\"UPDATE\\\",\\n                    \\\"old_memory\\\" : \\\"I really like cheese pizza\\\"\\n                }},\\n                {{\\n                    \\\"id\\\" : \\\"1\\\",\\n                    \\\"text\\\" : \\\"User is a software engineer\\\",\\n                    \\\"event\\\" : \\\"NONE\\\"\\n                }},\\n                {{\\n                    \\\"id\\\" : \\\"2\\\",\\n                    \\\"text\\\" : \\\"Loves to play cricket with friends\\\",\\n                    \\\"event\\\" : \\\"UPDATE\\\",\\n                    \\\"old_memory\\\" : \\\"User likes to play cricket\\\"\\n                }}\\n            ]\\n        }}\\n\\n\\n3. **Delete**: If the retrieved facts contain information that contradicts the information present in the memory, then you have to delete it.
